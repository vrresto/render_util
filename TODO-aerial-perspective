- multiple scattering artifacts at horizon
- simpler (but higher resolution) scattering density texture possible?
- merge frames into to one texture (and for each pixel blend between the nearest texture frame (sampling-offset-wise)) and the current frame
- criterium for old frame to be used: compare distance between camera and object (for old and current frame)
- transmittance frustum texture
- support multiple haze/fog layers (with their own physical parameters like MieAngstromBeta)
